ArUco Marker Detection
======================

**ArUco**

ArUco markers are easy to detect pattern grids that yield up to 1024 different patterns. They were built for augmented reality and later used for camera calibration. Since the grid uniquely orients the square, the detection algorithm can determing the pose of the grid.
